### Selected Requirements:

 - Alternate Control Device - This game is playable using a controller. You can use the D-PAD, Shoulder Buttons, and the A and B Buttons to play.

### Theme of the game: Distant in Time but Nearby in Space
 - Our alpha game features the player character as a futuristic ship fighting against prehistoric germs. We additonally included a player select to allow the players to use the beta game assets, thereby having the assets nearby in the space of the computer but distant in the time they were made.
