# Sceneflow Prototype

## Scene types
 - The four different scenes are:
 - Title screen
 - Gameplay scenes
 - Pre-gameplay scenes
 - Post-gameplay scenes
 - Credits scene

## Communication between scenes
 - A player's score on the gameplay scene will be displayed in the scene right after. 

## Reachability
 - The game is going to be very linear. All scenes can be reached linearly and the gameplay scenes can be cleared by pressing 'w'.

## Transitions
 - A pixelation transition is used for every scene change.
